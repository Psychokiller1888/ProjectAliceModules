# ProjectAliceSkills

This repository is home of all curated and approved skills for Project Alice.

You can share your own creation as well!

To do so, fork this repository and start adding your skills in a sub directory of **PublishedSkills** wearing **your Github username** as directory name. Once your skills tested and working, create a pull request for us to review your skill, check it and approve it. Once your skill is published it becomes available for everybody to install through the install ticket.

## Browse skills
TO browse and install new skills, use Alice's interface, or our skill store at [https://store.projectalice.io](https://store.projectalice.io)

## Skill Creation
You can create new skills directly from the Alice interface. To access the skill dev part, make sure to turn on the "devMode" setting!

We also made a python package that can help you create new skills, even without Alice running!

The Project Alice Skill Kit can be used both to automatically create the structure of new skills and to validate them.
It can be installed using 
```bash
pip3 install projectalice-sk
```
Further informations on how to use it can be found [here](https://github.com/project-alice-assistant/ProjectAliceSkillKit).
